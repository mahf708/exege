"""Read a latent archive: a directory of activations recorded from one model.

The layout is the interchange format between the environment that can run a
model and the one that studies it (``docs/latents.md`` is the reference)::

    manifest.json   times, layers, provenance, and what was done to the run
    grid.npz        lat, lon per node; optionally grid_shape, mask, area
    step_XX.npy     (n_times, n_nodes, n_channels), any float dtype, one per layer
    reference.nc    optional physical fields on the same grid

Layer files are memory-mapped, and only the requested time, nodes and channels
are ever read into memory. The reference file is opened with xarray, and only
when a mask or a field is asked of it.

An archive can also be read straight from a Hugging Face dataset repository,
``hf://datasets/<owner>/<repo>/<folder>`` (``exege[hf]``). Each file is downloaded
the first time something needs it and cached, so a notebook that looks at one
layer downloads one layer. Every file comes from the one commit the archive was
opened at: a requested branch or tag is resolved to its SHA, and both are recorded.

``write_archive`` is the other half: whatever can hand over arrays -- a toy model,
an exporter hooked into a real one -- writes the layout through it, so the writer
and the reader are tested against each other rather than against a description.
An archive too large to hold in memory is written a time at a time instead:
``start_archive`` lays it out, ``ArchiveFiller`` fills it (from several processes
at once, each on its own times), and ``finish_archive`` makes it readable.

    in the network, for an archive that keeps some layers and not others: a basis is
    matched to a layer by it. ``fields`` are physical fields on
    the same nodes, each ``(n_field_times, n_nodes)``; ``field_times`` labels their
    time axis and must hold every latent time -- it usually holds more, the state
    each step started from among them. The grid's mask and area travel in
    ``grid.npz`` when the grid has them. Field time labels must be unique.

    Metadata and shapes are checked up front; files are written in a sibling
    staging directory before replacing the destination. Failed writes leave an
    existing archive intact. Float conversion may round values, but overflow is
