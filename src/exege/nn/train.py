"""Fit a sparse autoencoder to a model's latents.

This is the one place ``nn`` reaches into ``latents``: the batches come from
``latents.iter_batches`` -- valid nodes only, drawn by area, so a plain mean
over a batch is already the area-weighted loss -- and what comes back is a
``latents.Dictionary``, which every analysis and the CLI take wherever they
take a PCA.

It is a toy loop on purpose: Adam, a fixed learning rate, no resampling of dead
features. It trains a useful dictionary on a laptop in minutes, and says how good
it is; making it better is what the modules being separate is for.

    Inputs are centered on the layer's area-weighted mean over the times used and
    divided by one number, so that a node's vector has unit mean square per
    channel; the channels keep their relative sizes. ``l1`` is on that scale.
    Feature directions are kept at unit length throughout, so an activation is in
    the same units for every feature: how much of the (standardized) layer it
    accounts for at that node.
    With ``target_layer`` the block learns to write that layer instead of
    rebuilding its input: a transcoder.

    With ``node_norm`` each node is first centered over its channels and scaled to
    unit RMS (``latents.node_normalize``), and the standardization above is
    then taken over normalized nodes: the geometry a pre-norm block reads, as
    MacMillan & Ouellette (2025) trained on. The dictionary records it, and is
    still handed raw latents.

    ``meta["metrics"]`` describes the dictionary returned: the fraction of variance
    explained, the mean number of active features per node, and the fraction of
    features that never fired, measured in a pass of the frozen final model over
    the last epoch's batches. ``meta["training_metrics"]`` holds the same three as
    the loop saw them during that epoch, while the weights were still moving; it
    is a monitor, not a result. ``progress(step, reconstruction)`` is called every
    ``log_every`` steps, if given.

    ``meta["history"]`` is the loss curve: every ``log_every`` steps, that
    batch's reconstruction error and the fraction of its variance left
    unexplained. With ``holdout_times``, times left out of training, a fixed
    sample of their nodes (drawn by area, as training is) is scored every
    ``eval_every`` steps and at the end, as ``meta["history"]["holdout"]``: a
    rising held-out curve under a falling training one is overfitting, which the
    training curve alone cannot show.
