# adapters — the disposable half

Every assumption about a specific framework, scheduler, file layout or log format lives
here. This code is expected to be thrown away when the group changes systems; what uses
it is not.

## The factory contract

```python
factory(source, **options) -> adapter
```

- **`source`** is whatever the adapter reads — a path, a directory, a URL. It is passed
  positionally, so **the first positional parameter is the source**, whatever it is
  called. An adapter that reads nothing declares its options keyword-only.
- **`options`** are keyword arguments: what a command was given (`--mask-variable`), or
  `**kwargs` from the API. An option the factory does not declare is an error listing the
  ones it does.
- **context** is offered by the caller, not the user (a campaign spec, say). It reaches
  only a factory that declares a parameter of that name. `**kwargs` is not a declaration
  (what a factory hands on to another library must not hold xaig's objects), and the
  source parameter never receives it.

The adapter returned is **one object implementing one or more protocols**. Callers ask
with `isinstance`, so everything one framework can supply travels under one name:

| Protocol | Method | Consumer |
|---|---|---|
| `daig.latent.LatentSource` | `info()`, `grid()`, `load(time, layer, …)` | `daig`, `taig` |
| `daig.latent.ReferenceFields` | `field_names()`, `field(name, time)` → per-node values | `daig` |

An adapter may also *write* what it reads: a `write(path, **contents)` on the class the
registry hands out. `daig.latent.toy` reaches the archive writer that way, by name, and a
writer is always tested against its own reader.

## Registering

Entry points are the only mechanism, for the adapters shipped here and for one living in
a completely separate distribution alike:

```toml
[project.entry-points."xaig.adapters"]
myframework = "mypkg.adapter:MyAdapter"
```

Then **rerun `uv sync`**: entry points are read from installed
metadata, and a stale install is the usual reason a new adapter "is not found". xaig's
own names win a clash, so a plugin can add adapters but never silently replace one.

## Rules

- An adapter may import `xaig.core` and the domain contract it implements
  (`xaig.daig.latent`). Nothing imports an adapter; it is reached through the registry.
- Heavy dependencies go behind an extra and are imported by the adapter, which loads
  lazily — never at `import xaig` time.
- A source that is broken is an `AdapterError`; a request it cannot meet (a node index out
  of range, a field it does not hold) is a `RequestError`. Never a bare `IndexError`.
- Carry what the exporter said. A latent adapter puts the manifest's free-form
  `experiment` block, and the options it was opened with, into `LatentInfo`, so they
  reach the provenance of every result.
- Read selectively. A `LatentSource` asked for a region must not load the layer.

## Present adapters

- `latent_archive.py` — activations recorded from a model, as a directory of
  memory-mapped arrays, with the physical fields kept beside them; `write_archive` writes
  one (`xaig[daig]`; format in `docs/package/latents.md`).
