"""Adapter lookup and construction.

Adapters are found through the ``xaig.adapters`` entry-point group and through
nothing else, so the adapters shipped here and one from a separate distribution
are resolved identically -- and core never names an adapter module. Loading is
lazy: an adapter's heavy dependencies are imported only when it is asked for.

The factory contract, in full::

    factory(source, **options) -> adapter

- ``source`` is whatever the adapter reads (a path, a directory, a URL). It is
  passed positionally, so the adapter may call its first parameter anything.
- ``options`` are keyword arguments. One the factory does not accept is an error
  naming the ones it does; a typo must not silently mean "use the default".

What the object returned must implement is the caller's business: whoever asks
for an adapter checks it against the contract it needs.
