"""Bases: fitted things that turn a node's channels into features.

A principal-component basis, a sparse dictionary learned by an autoencoder, a
transcoder -- they differ in how they were found and agree in what is done with
them afterwards: project a layer onto them, map a feature, ask which channels it
is made of, push a model along it. ``Decomposition`` is that shared part, so an
analysis and the CLI take "the method" as a value.

A basis is fitted once, often somewhere else (a dictionary is trained with
torch), and used many times, so it has a file of its own: one ``.npz`` holding
plain arrays and a JSON record of how it was made. It is xaig's own
interchange format, written and read here and nowhere else. It is also the
hand-off *back* to the model's environment, which needs nothing but numpy to read
a row of ``directions`` and steer along it.
