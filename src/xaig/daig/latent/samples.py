"""Many times at once: moments of a layer, and batches to train on.

``analyse_region`` looks at one time. Fitting something *to a model* -- a global
PCA, a sparse dictionary -- wants every node of every time, which is a million
vectors and does not need to be in memory: moments accumulate, and batches are
drawn a time at a time.

The two rules of ``daig.grid`` hold here as well, and are as easy to forget:

- **Area.** A 1-degree grid has as many nodes in its last row as on the equator,
  covering 1/115 of the area. Nodes are therefore weighted by area in the
  moments and *drawn* by area in the batches, so a plain mean over a batch is
  already the area-weighted loss.
- **Mask.** Invalid nodes are never counted and never drawn. A third of an ocean
  model's nodes are land, and the network does not leave them empty: on the
  SamudrACE-E3SMv3 ocean its last layer is *larger* over land than over sea (RMS
  0.60 against 0.50). Nothing in the latents marks those nodes as meaningless, so
  a source opened without its mask trains a dictionary on them and cannot warn.
