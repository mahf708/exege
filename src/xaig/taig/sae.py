"""A sparse autoencoder over a model's latents, as plain torch blocks.

One node's vector of channels goes in; a wide, mostly-zero vector of *features*
comes out, from which the input is rebuilt. The hope is the usual one: channels
are entangled, and features, being few at a time, are easier to name.

Blocks take and return tensors and know nothing of archives, grids or training
loops (``xaig.taig.train`` has those), so they can be lifted into any harness.
Inputs are expected standardised; that is the caller's business.

Trained against another layer instead of its own input, the same block is a
*transcoder*: it reads one layer and writes a later one, and its features are
then steps of computation rather than directions of representation. A
cross-layer transcoder is several of these sharing an encoder.
