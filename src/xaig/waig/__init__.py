Presentation only. Every number on screen comes from ``xaig.daig`` and every
figure from ``xaig.faig``, so anything seen here can be reproduced in a notebook
or a batch job -- the app says how. Nothing imports this package.

Needs the ``waig`` extra (streamlit, plus everything ``faig`` and ``daig`` need).
